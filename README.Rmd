## How to download your FB profile as a zip file

myFBr uses a copy of Facebook data downloaded from your Facebook profile  (see Figure 1). Use the function 'download a copy of your Facebook data' in the settings section of your Facebook profile (full instructions for downloading data from Facebook accounts are presented in the following official Facebook link: https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467/ ; see Figure 1). You will have to download a zip folder containing several html pages. They included friendship activities, events, wall activities, text messages, photos, ect.
